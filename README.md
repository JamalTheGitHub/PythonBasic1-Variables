# PythonBasic1-Variables

Prerequisite => From this tutorial onwards, it is expected that you have the following extensions in your Visual Studio Code;

<strong>Code Runner</strong>
<strong>Python<strong>

If you want to know more on how to get Python on Visual Studio Code, google it.

First thing first, create a file called called whatever you want it to be called and save it as ".py". For example like this, "PythonTutorial.py". Navigate to that file and do your coding there.

===================================================================================================


<u><strong>print()</strong></u> Function

    print("Hello Python")

    print('Hello Python')

Notice that the single quotes and double quotes will yield the same output. To do this press "Ctrl", "Alt" and "n" on the keyboard simultaneously. This will use the "Code Runner" extension and run the code. If you want to do it manually, You could type in the terminal python <filename>.py provided that you are in the directory where your file was created and saved.

Besides that, you can also use the same function to print integer like;

    print(3)

In which it will yield the integer "3". Now that We have understood the simple concept of the <strong>print()<strong> function, we can move on to Variables.
